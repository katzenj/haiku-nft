# haiku-nft

## Why

As I dive more into web3 and building, I figured I would attempt to combine my budding interest in poetry with learning a bit more about NFTs & smart contracts.

I roughly followed the nft tutorial on buildspace, but had done their other tutorials -- wave app and gif links on solana -- 
so knew my way around the smart contract portion and the frontend. Plus, I really wanted to use [wagmi](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi/) and test it out
in an app.

## What does it do
Generates a haiku SVG that lives on-chain. The haiku created is the same each time, but I'm currently exploring two separate possibilities:
1. a "random" haiku from a set I created where you can edit the text color and background color
2. a static haiku that you can then update yourself to contain whatever you want (within reason/with limits)
    - user input is always tricky, so I'm focusing primarily on #1 for the time being
